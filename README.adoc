== Development

== System Requirements

* https://nodejs.org[NodeJS] 10.13+


=== Used Tools

* https://www.typescriptlang.org[TypeScript] the language
* https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript[ttypescript] wrapper for `tsc` allowing to use custom AST transformers
* https://yarnpkg.com[yarn] for dependencies management and building
* https://eslint.org[ESLint] for linting JS/TypeScript code
* https://jestjs.io[Jest] for testing


=== How to Start

. Clone this repository:
[source, subs="+attributes"]
git clone https://github.com/{gh-name}.git

. Install Yarn (if you donâ€™t have it already):
[source]
npm install -g yarn

. Install all JS dependencies:
[source]
yarn install

. Build the project:
[source]
yarn build

. Run tests and generate code coverage:
[source]
yarn test

. Run linter:

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that JS sources are located in the directory `src`; directory `lib` contains transpiled code (created after running `yarn build`)!
